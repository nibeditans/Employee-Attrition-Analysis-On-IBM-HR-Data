# Employee Attrition Analysis on IBM HR Data

This project presents a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on IBM's HR Employee Attrition dataset using Python. The primary objective is to uncover key patterns and insights related to employee turnover through visualization and statistical techniques.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Analysis Steps
- Dataset inspection: shape, types, missing values, duplicates
- Summary statistics & column categorization
- Visual analysis of numeric features like Age, Monthly Income, Total Working Years
- Attrition distribution with breakdowns by Job Role, Department, Education Field
- Correlation heatmap to uncover relationships among numeric features
- Comparative analysis between employees who stayed vs. those who left using:
    - Histograms
    - Violin plots
    - Countplots
 
That's it! I've already added clear explanations inside the notebook itself, there shouldn't be any issues on understing the concepts. Otherwise, always! Feel free to ask!
